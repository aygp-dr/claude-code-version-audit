* Claude Code Version Audit

** Background

This repository provides tools for auditing npm packages to track feature additions, changes, and investigate issues.

The initial investigation focuses on when specific commands (~/doctor~ and ~/migrate-installer~) were added to the Claude Code npm package.

** Current Issue Investigation

We're currently investigating an issue where the ~/migrate-installer~ command in Claude Code fails on FreeBSD systems:

- The local installation process runs but results in a non-functioning executable
- Error message: ~-bash: /home/jwalsh/.claude/local/claude: cannot execute: required file not found~
- The file exists and has execute permissions, but cannot be executed on FreeBSD
- The issue may be related to compatibility differences between Linux/macOS and FreeBSD

Reference:
- Issue #567 on GitHub (Missing ~/migrate-installer~ Command in CLI)
- 0.2.48 mentioned as a version that prompts use of this command

** Usage

*** Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make init
#+END_SRC

*** Run the Audit
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make audit
#+END_SRC

*** Refresh Submodules
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make refresh
#+END_SRC

*** Clean Up
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make clean
#+END_SRC

** Notes

- The audit script downloads and extracts multiple versions of the package to track when features were added
- For FreeBSD compatibility, all scripts use #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of direct paths
- The repo includes the official anthropics/claude-code repository as a submodule for reference

** Additional Investigations

This toolkit can be extended to audit other npm packages or investigate different issues:

1. Edit the versions array in the audit script to target different package versions
2. Modify the grep patterns to search for other features or changes of interest
3. Extend the Makefile with additional analysis tools as needed
