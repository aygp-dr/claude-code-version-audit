#+TITLE: Investigation: /migrate-installer Command in Claude Code
#+AUTHOR: jwalsh
#+DATE: 2025-04-02

* Issue Description

The ~/migrate-installer~ command in Claude Code has been introduced to help transition from global npm installations to local installations, but has several issues on FreeBSD systems.

** Symptoms

- Local installation succeeds but produces a non-executable file
- Error message: ~-bash: /home/jwalsh/.claude/local/claude: cannot execute: required file not found~
- The file exists with proper permissions but fails to execute on FreeBSD

** Environment

- Operating System: FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE
- Architecture: amd64
- Node.js version: v22.13.1
- Bash version: GNU bash 5.2.37(0)-release (amd64-portbld-freebsd14.1)
- Claude Code version: 0.2.56

* Research Findings

** Command History

Based on GitHub issues and package version research, the ~/migrate-installer~ command appears to have been introduced around version 0.2.48, as evidenced by issue #567 where a user reported the command was mentioned but not available.

The issue was reported with version 0.2.48 which suggests the command was being referenced in error messages or documentation before it was fully implemented.

** Related GitHub Issues

- Issue #567: "Missing `/migrate-installer` Command in CLI"
  - User reported version 0.2.48 suggesting to use the command
  - Platform: macOS
  - Terminal: WarpTerminal

- No closed issues specifically addressing ~/migrate-installer~ implementation were found

** Command Purpose

The ~/migrate-installer~ command was introduced to help users transition from problematic global npm installations to more secure local installations. This addresses permission issues that occur when:

1. npm global prefix is not user-writable (e.g., /usr or /usr/local)
2. Users need to run with elevated permissions (sudo)

** Current Behavior

When running ~/migrate-installer~:

1. A local installation is created at ~/.claude/local/
2. An alias is added to the user's shell configuration
3. The globally installed npm package is removed
4. On FreeBSD, the resulting executable fails to run

* Technical Analysis

** File Structure

- The local installation creates ~/.claude/local/claude
- File permissions are correctly set: -rwxr-xr-x
- The file is owned by the correct user
- The file is 75 bytes in size

** Working Components

The underlying script at ~/home/jwalsh/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/claude-restart.sh~ does work correctly when executed directly.

** Shell Scripts Analysis

Found shebangs in the codebase:
- cli.js: ~#!/usr/bin/env -S node --no-warnings --enable-source-maps~
- claude-restart.sh: ~#!/usr/bin/env bash~

The issue likely stems from platform-specific assumptions in the local wrapper script that don't account for FreeBSD's environment.

* Workarounds

** Method 1: Direct Invocation

Create an alias that directly calls the working script:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
alias claude="/home/jwalsh/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/claude-restart.sh"
#+END_SRC

** Method 2: Custom Wrapper Script

Create a custom wrapper script in ~/bin:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/bin

# Create a wrapper script
cat > ~/bin/claude << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec /home/jwalsh/.claude/local/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/claude-restart.sh "$@"
EOF

# Make it executable
chmod +x ~/bin/claude

# Add to PATH if needed
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
#+END_SRC

* Next Steps

** Version Audit

Continue investigating versions to determine:
- When ~/doctor~ command was added
- When ~/migrate-installer~ was actually implemented (beyond just being referenced)
- Whether platform-specific code in the installer accounts for BSD systems

** Potential Solution

A proper fix would likely involve:
1. Updating the local installer to account for FreeBSD paths and environment
2. Adding BSD compatibility to the migration scripts
3. Testing installation on multiple BSD variants

** Further Documentation

Document the findings in the GitHub issue tracker to help others facing similar issues on BSD systems.
